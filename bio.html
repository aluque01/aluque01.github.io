		<p>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;I am a Cuban immigrant and first generation college student originally from Guantanamo, Cuba, and living in Miami, Florida. I decided I needed to change my environment and ended up 1,500 miles away in the city of Medford. I am a full time student at the Tufts University School of Engineering, where I am currently a part of the Society of Latino Engineers and Scientists, as well as the Association of Latin American Students. As of now I am working in the Center for STEM Diversity helping maintain their website, and will hopefully be working on a full redesign in the coming month.  </p>
