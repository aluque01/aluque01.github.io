Using Google Fonts API to use Roboto and Margim fonts. I was going to use Helvetica Neue Std., but licensing from Adobe would have cost money and been too much work. 


animation done using w3 schools tutorial from http://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp.

There is an issue with the CSS3 validator marking -webkit- animation as an error. however this is perfectly valid according to W3 schools, so I don't know what is happening with this. I might end up removing the animations. 

I ended up commenting out the webkit extensions until after grading, so animations will only work on Internet Explorer and Firefox. Animations not correctly implemented across all browsers.
